Translations files for GoNevis backend.


## How to Translate

If you have decided to add new or contribute to the any existing translation
files, we welcome you.

Translations files are in [gettext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext).

You can either translate them online directly via Github edit feature, or you
user one of the recommended tools below:


* [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) The best editor for translating apps and
sites (that use gettext). Simple. Fast. Easy to use.
* [Lokalize](https://userbase.kde.org/Lokalize): Lokalize is the localization tool for KDE and other open source software
* [Virtaal](http://virtaal.translatehouse.org/): Virtaal, a feature rich translation tool that allows you to focus on translation, without the tool getting in the way.
* [Localise online Poeditor](https://localise.biz/free/poeditor): It's a PO file editor that works directly in your browser.
It's the same one we use in the Loco translator dashboard.
